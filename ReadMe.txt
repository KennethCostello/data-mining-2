My code is split across two files main.py & methods.py. 
My code is designed the display the top topics discussed across the 15 top posts in hot under subreddits ‘dublin’ and ‘ireland’.
This is done by means of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). 
It also provides a countplot graph to show the length of all comments in both subreddits. 

Update reddit details in creds.py to get this working!!
